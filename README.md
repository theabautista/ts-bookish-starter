# Typescript Bookish Starter

## Overview

This repo contains a starter Express server for use in the Bookish bootcamp exercise. Full details of this exercise are on the Swiki page.

## Developer Setup

1. If you haven't already, install Node.js v16.13.0, NPM and NVM. There are instructions for how to do this on Windows (with and without WSL) [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-overview).
2. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or another preferred editor). VSCode is recommended unless you have a strong preference otherwise due to its good compatibility with typescript, excellent community extensions and for consistency across all developers when pairing.
3. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Run the code!
     - Run in development mode with hot reloading with `npm run dev`
     - Run without hot reloading using `npm start`
